Write a game in html that has gravity for all objects like a player or a trap and has a 20 * 20 player that is blue and can move with w, a, s, d and space for jump in a 500*500 canvas with black borders which if collide with the player hold him. Also make plattforms that keep the  player  on them when touching him which are red and 50 * 10. Randomly spawn the plattforms which are red and randomly spawn 20 plattforms at the beginning of the game . Make sure its impossible for the plattforms to spawn in the player. Write the game code with the intention of creating a finished game.
