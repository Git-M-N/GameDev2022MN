  <h1>Asian economy in the 90s </h1>
  
  <p> 
The 1990s were a period of great economic growth for many countries in Asia. Following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, the economies of East and Southeast Asia stabilized and began to rapidly expand as a result of high levels of foreign investment, improved economic policies, and increasing trade. Countries such as China, South Korea, and India experienced significant economic growth, while other countries such as Japan and Thailand experienced slower, yet still robust, growth. The growth of the region was driven in large part by the emergence of the Chinese economy, which underwent a period of rapid industrialization and economic liberalization. This allowed China to become a major player in the global economy and a key source of foreign investment for the region. In addition, the increased access to global markets and the growth of technology enabled many Asian economies to become more competitive and expand their exports. The period also saw the emergence of regional economic integration, with the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This organization, which was established in 1967, sought to strengthen economic and political ties between its member countries, and to promote economic cooperation and integration. The success of ASEAN, along with the growth of other regional organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit (EAS), has helped to further promote economic integration, and to foster greater collaboration between the countries of the region. As a result of these developments, the Asian economies of the 1990s saw strong growth and development, and have since become major players in the global economy.   </p>
